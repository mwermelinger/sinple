# SINPLE

SINPLE (SImple Network Python Library for Education) is a pedagogical (*not* a state-of-the-art) implementation of basic network concepts in Python.

It is pedagogical at various levels:

- It illustrates basic Python constructs: loops, functions, tuples, sets, etc.
- It illustrates a simple form of unit testing.
- It explains basic graph theoretical concepts through executable definitions (the functions) and concrete examples (the unit tests).
- It is extensively documented. You can run [Pycco](http://fitzgen.github.io/pycco/) on the Python code to generate a side-by-side view of documentation and code. 
- It includes exercises.

The `docs` folder contains the output of running Pycco.
